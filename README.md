These are some practice interview questions for my Udacity class. I try to minimize the time and space complexities of my solutions.

All of the solutions are in Python 2. You can check out each solution (question1.py, question2.py, etc). The explanations.txt file gives my 
thought process on each solution and why I made certain programming choices.

Thanks to geeksforgeeks.org for their guide on Kruskal's Algorithm.
