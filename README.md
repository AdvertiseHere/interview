# Udacity Interview Questions

These are some practice interview questions for my Udacity class. I try to minimize the time and space complexities of my solutions.

## Software
All of the solutions are in Python 2. You can check out each solution (question1.py, question2.py, etc). The explanations.txt file gives my thought process on each solution and why I made certain programming choices.


##### You can install Python 2.7 [here](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/).
You may already have Python installed. You can check in your terminal by typing `python --version` .

Once you have Python installed, copy a solution to your local directory. Open that directory in your terminal and test the code. For example, to test question1.py, you would run this:

```
python question1.py
```
